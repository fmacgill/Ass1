## Script

The run_anlysis script provides a summary of the  Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones data set. The summary includes the average/mean  of only the mean and standard deviation (std) measurement for thee 30 participants performing 6 activities.

###  instructions

1. download run_analyis.R
2. place in working directory
